                                            <p>Once a upon a time, not very long ago lived a scientist named Dave. Dave made a robot with weapons such as laser guns. The robot was named Fighter. The robot had the strength of a 1000 people. Dave made millions of robots like Fighter such as Fighter 2.0, Warrior and Soldier. Some robots such as Genius and Modern Einstein had the brain of a 1000 people. Dave became a very famous scientist. He soon surpassed the IQ of Albert Einstein and became the smartest human ever on Earth. Few days later, he was making a robot as usual when he made a mistake while coding and the robot turned evil and killed the scientist. The robotâ€™s name was Shooter. Shooter hypnotized every robot on earth and turned evil. Millions of humans died during the beginning of the robot apocalypse. Humans declared war against the robots. Millions of humans sacrificed their lives against the robots but all went in vain and the robots emerged victorious. The humans were slaves of robots and made more robots to increase the robot population. Soon, robots went to space and started taking over and discovering more about space. Humans were taken in space to work for the robots. Humans worked for the robots all the time. Humans used to serve robots for many years until a human named Steve decided to fight back but all humans refused as it was too risky to fight back. So everyone continued working for the robots. Steve was a very special human. Steve decided to end all robots and AIs forever but he did not know how to? He decided to research but he did not have Computer. So, Steve decided to ask the robots for a computer but the robots refused to give him a computer. Then, he decided to steal a computer from the robots. Computers could be found in Private Robot infested areas so Steve went there to get a computer. To his surprise there were 1,000,000 robots. So, he sneaked and killed a robot and took its laser gun. He killed a million robots using the laser gun. He soon reached the computer room and found out how to end all robots. He would have to kill shooter and he even learned the history of Dave. The problem was, there were a trillion guards protecting Shooter at all times and he could not fight a trillion guards on his own as he could barely survive against a million guards. So, he decided to talk to the humans again. He told the humans what he found on the internet and brought a trillion lasers guns for everyone. Everyone agreed and went to kill Shooter. Shooter lived on Earth whereas Steve lived on Saturn so he stole a rocket and went to Earth. On his way he met people from every corner of the Solar System. Soon humans from the Solar System joined the army. Humans attacked the Earth, Shooter realized that humans were attacking and was outnumbered. It called every robot but was shot by Steve. All robots turned back to normalcy.</p>
